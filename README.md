3. Building
-----------
EdisonEngine uses [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg); refer to its documentation for basic usage,
but the only thing you need is to call cmake with
`-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/devel/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake` (adjust path as necessary).

This is the list of the required libraries to be installed with `vcpkg install` (remember to
set the target triplet as necessary, e.g. `vcpkg install boost:x64-windows`):
* boost
* glfw3
* glew
* ms-gsl
* libpng
* openal-soft
* opengl
* lua
* glm
* zlib
* libsndfile
* freetype
* yaml-cpp
* assimp
